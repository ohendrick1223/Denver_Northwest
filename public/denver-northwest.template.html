  <h2 class="text-center">ABOUT</h2>
  <h3>Northwest Denver, often referred to as, "The Highlands", is located up on a series of rolling bluffs northwest of Downtown. It is comprised of six small, but distinct neighborhoods: Berkeley, Sunnyside, West Highland, Lower Highland, Sloan Lake and Jefferson Park. The area is known for being 'up and coming', full of some of Denver's best foodie spots, continual new housing developments and hip shopping areas. As gentrification continues to dramatically change the cultural and physical makeup of the area, this site aims to look back in order to look forward.</h3><br>

  <h3>The area around Denver was once home to Southern Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Shoshonis, and Ute Indian tribes. In the early 19th century, news about the West and the wealth it might bring picqued the interest of many. Prospectors began to explore the Colorado area in droves in the 1850s, and the Treaty of Fort Laramie (signed in 1851) between the local tribes and the U.S. Government was broken. Land was staked out in the name of new developers and frontiersmen, and in November of 1858 the communities of Denver & Auraria were established. A month later, William Larimer and D.C. Collier (two developers responsible for the founding of the Denver & Auraria communities), waded out into the partially frozen Platte river to examine the land on the west bank. They laid down cottonwood logs along a square mile parcel of land on the hill, and thus, the story of Highlands began. <br> With the Pikes Peak Goldrush underway, the expansion of the West saw thousands of people beginning to migrate across the land seeking fortune in the Rocky Mountains. Despite this influx of people, land in the newly established Highland area was hard to sell. Limited accessibility to the area across the river drove the market. One such landowner, A.C. Wright, tried to sell his land (136 lots) in 1859 to Jose Merival for a horse, saddle and bridle, only to be declined as the horse was worth more. Nevertheless, William Larimer continued to portion off land to miners and migrants traveling through, only to see many of the tracts traded in gambling games and for provisions to continue mining explorations. During the end of 1859 and through 1860, Highland started to become more desirable through projects aimed at accessibility. Some such were the "Platte River Bridge project", a Ferry service across the Platte, the completion of the first bridge across the Platte at 15th st, and new Branding and Marketing of the Highland area: "No more handsome location for residences can be found than on the highlands of Highland, on the opposite side of the river from and overlooking Auraria and Denver, and a vast extent of the surrounding territory"-Rocky Mountain News, 1859. It was in 1859 as well, that the once warring communities of Auraria and Denver decided to merge, along with Highland to become the City of Denver. By 1861, Congress had officially formed the Colorado Territory and named Denver the capital. In 1862, the Homesteading Act was passed, giving away up to 160 acres for free to anyone over twenty-one who planned to live and work on the land. Highland was beginning to get it's start.<br>
